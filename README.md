# WinClean
Windows optimization and debloating utility. 

Allows the average Windows user to improve performance in a few clicks.

## Features

- Run *Batch*, *PowerShell*, and *Registry Editor* debloating scripts directly from the GUI.
- Add custom scripts to futher debloat the system.
- But if you don't have the time to do all of that, simply click on "Select scripts", "Advised", and "Run Scripts"

## ~~Yet Another PC Optimizer Scam~~

WinClean was designed with the intent of giving the user full control of it.
Basically, you know what's happening under the hood.

## Specs

- .NET 6
- WPF
- Created with Visual Studio 2019/2022
