## Features
- Run *Batch*, *PowerShell*, and *Registry Editor* debloating scripts directly from the GUI.
- Add custom scripts to futher debloat the system.
- But if you don't have the time to do all of that, simply click on "Select scripts", "Recommended", and "Run Scripts"

## ~~Yet Another PC Optimizer Scam~~
WinClean was designed with the intent of giving the user full control of it.
Basically, you know what's happening under the hood.

## Specs
- .NET 6
- WPF
- Created with Visual Studio 2019/2022
